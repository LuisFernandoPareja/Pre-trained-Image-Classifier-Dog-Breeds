Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

Answer: Yes, the three architectures classified correctly both images Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as collie


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, they classified Crow_01.jpg and Bike_01.jpg as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The three architectures did just fine, but if I had to choose one, I would choose the resnet architecture because it not only classified the images almost instantly, but took a better guess (still wrong) when classifying the crow as a magpie which is more similar to it than a black grouse (alexnet's classification for a crow). And finally I didn't choose vgg over resnet just because the time it took to process/classify the four images (since vgg and resnet got the same classifications).
